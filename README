GenIII Prototype Analysis

DATA PIPELINE:

GeometryDataFrame.ipynb
- Outputs a "Geometry.pkl" file containing the channel mapping information
for the real prototype.

Pedestal_Analysis.ipynb
- Use the raw txt Janus output from a PTRG run "PTRG_list.txt" as input.
- Recieve a "PTRG.pkl" file, containing a list of pedestal means and stds for 
all channels.

HGLG-Ratio.ipynb
- Use the raw txt Janus output from a beam or cosmic run "Beam_list.txt" as input.
- Recieve a "HGLG.pkl" file, containing a list of HG/LG ratios for all channels.

Cosmic_analysis.ipynb
- Use the raw txt Janus output from a beam or cosmic run "Cosmic_list.txt" and the 
"PTRG.pkl" file as input. Ensure "PTRG.pkl" comes from a run with the same gain and 
pedestal settings.
- Recieve "MIP.pkl" file, containing a list of MIP values for all channels.

Apply_Calibrations.ipynb
- Use the event built ROOT file from a beam run "Beam_data.root", "Geometry.pkl", "PTRG.pkl", 
"HGLG.pkl", and "MIP.pkl" files. Ensure all files come from runs with the same gain 
and pedestal settings.
- Recieve "Beam_Calibrated.pkl" file, containing MIP calibrated and pedestal subtracted/
supressed events.


SIMULATION PIPELINE:

Sim_Muon_Analysis.ipynb
- Use a simulated "Muon.root" file as input.
- Determines the MIP value for a simulated detector.

Sim_Geometry.ipynb
- Use a simulated "Beam.root" file as input.
- Outputs "Sim_Geometry.pkl" file as output.

SimToPkl.ipynb
- Use a simulated "Beam.root" file, MIP value, and "Sim_Geometry.pkl" file as input.
- Outputs a "Sim_Beam.pkl" file as output.


ANALYSIS:

Beam_Analysis.ipynb
- Uses "Sim_Beam.pkl" and "Beam_Calibrated.pkl" files as input.

Raw_Spectra_Analysis.ipynb
- Use the raw txt Janus output from a beam or cosmic run "Beam_list.txt" as input

PrototypeToVIRTUE.ipynb
- Use "Sim_Beam.pkl" or "Beam_Calibrated.pkl" file as input.
- Outputs "ZDCPrototype.json" file, which can be imported into VIRTUE for animating.
